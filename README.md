**EAP(CLE030)** is a must-learn English course @SUSTech. 'EAP' stands for 'English for academic purposes', which focuses on academic presenting and writing.

The course itself is not that hard, while the key is to formalize your expression and to know rules to obey in academic things.

I took the course in Spring 2025, and this repository listed all courseware I used.
